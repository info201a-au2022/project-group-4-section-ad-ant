Be Safe with WAC by knowing the safety status in Washington Area!

## Abstract
As we looked into the crime rate in the USA, we wondered why it's absurdly high. Then we ask ourselves, "If people can open their weather app to understand the weather status in an area, why isn't there a crime app informing the safety status of an area we're in?". Thus, our crew creates WAC (Washington Crime), an integrated platform that tells us the area safety status in based on safety score, prison rate, and common type of crime in an area to address the problem.

## Introduction
During the first few weeks of the quarter, the UW community has been swamped with violence. There has been no sort of general system or data that tackles the issue of reducing victims caused by common crimes. This is important as our basic rights and needs as humans have the right to their safety. As informatics students, we try to accomplish this through our way of using knowledge learned in the class. Our goal is to reduce the number of victims from these criminal acts starting within the state of Washington. We plan to do this by collecting a set of data from the official government website of reported crimes around each county in Washington. These crimes include theft, shootings, vandalism, assault, and many more. We then proceed to analyze and present the data to the public of the safety score of area they are in, prison rate, and common type of crime so they can make informed decision in avoiding certain areas with low safety score. The summary of the data will be presented on a website.

## Problem Domain

#### Project Framing
Early in the quarter, UW students were alerted by near UW. This news definitely triggered our anxiety. How is it possible for us to feel safe knowing that area near our school isn’t even safe? (Magaña & Zhou, 2022). Not only so, looking at the US reported violent crime graph from 1990 to 2021, this country is very familiar with violent crimes (FBI, 2022). Despite the decrease being visible, the numbers started to rise again from that point. Furthermore, it is great to keep in mind that the decrease of number doesn’t mean our country is safer. It is possible that criminals change their methods. New York Times show the shift in crimes. Although violent crimes such as murder is declining, there are few types of crimes that are inclining such as property crimes (Lopez, 2022). However, we will focus mainly on violent crimes in this project.

#### Human Values
Our team believes that every Washingtonians deserve to feel safe living here. Thus, we create WAC which can help Washingtonians make informed decisions on when to go out and understand if the area they’re in is safe or not. We realized that crimes data are all scattered on the internet. We think it’d be great if we can compile all the safety status based on safety score, prison rate, and common type of crime in an area that people can see it in a platform.

#### Stakeholders (Direct & Indirect)
Direct Stakeholders will be the users. The users would most likely be Washington residents or visitors since we only provide this platform for Washington area based on the counties. It directly impacts their decision making by being more careful of visiting certain areas. Thus, they can change their decisions of visiting the area according to the safety status. As for the indirect stakeholders, it can be the business owners the unsafe place. Their customer waves may change depending on the safety status. Business owners in the area with high safety score, low prison rate can receive more customers.

#### Possible Harms and Benefits
The Washingtonian may benefit from this platform because they are being informed of unsafe place. It helps them make an informed decision to go out or not so they can make preventive measures. However, some criminals may take advantage of this app. They will be able to see the safety status and start committing crimes in the middle of safe area. Furthermore, this app only provides existing information but would not predict future crimes since we do not have our own investigation team & don't provide safety status real-time update.


## Research Questions
1.  **Are UW students more susceptible to violent crimes than Washington State residents?**

    - This question is important to understand the sentiment surrounding the basis of our project. What motivates this question is the fact that if students feel safe and have no concerns about the violent criminal activity, our project ceases to have any relevancy or impact.

2.  **What would make the UW community feel more safe as criminal activity continues to rise?**

    - This question is important because the suggestions that the UW community poses are a direct reflection of things that would increase their feeling of safety. What motivates this question is rather than guess and check what would make the community feel safer, we can ask the community and expand off of their insights.

3. **What are some ways that the UW community can keep each other informed on the severity of the criminal activity in the area?**

    - This question is important because it allows us to analyze what the community at hand believes will be beneficial to keep them informed for their safety. What motivates this question is CBPR (community based participatory research) which is the research approach that equitably involves community members in the research process to effectively target the problem at hand.

4. **In what ways does our data hold power?**

    - This questions is important because we will actively be in communication with marginalized groups and stakeholders. Being cognisent of the power we hold, working with this data, is essential so that we can better cater towards those who will be affected by the data. Not solely the ones who consume it.

## The Dataset
(1) Our data set will aid us in answering our research questions in a few ways. First, after analyzing the data collected, we will begin to display our findings on a website that contains all relevant information. This answers the question on how the community could help each other on the severity of crime in an area. After looking at our findings, the community could better prepare themselves and others close to them by referring to the website. Secondly, our data set has data for crimes in all of the counties & cities in Washington. From there, we could look up which crime is common in a certain area, the safety score, and prison rate. This will help the community feel a lot more safe, as they have a sense of how dangerous or safe an area is.

(4) The data is collected by Washington Statistical Analysis Center. Washington Statistical Analysis Center or WSAC specializes in collecting data surrounding crime and justice. Their data is used for Washington policy and budget development. Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Justice Programs, and US Department of Justice funded WSAC through a grant. Since the data from Washington Statistical Analysis Center is being used for creating and revising Washington Policy, those who gained benefit from it can be any institutions that may be related to crime prevention. Furthermore, this data is being used as the reference for budget development, some institutions may receive more or less budget because of this data. Hence, reliable data surveillance must be very strict. The commissioner need to make sure that the data is not being manipulated so people can take advantage from it. Washington Statistical Analysis Center uses Summary Reporting System (SRS) and National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and they are part of FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting System. We obtained the data from Washington Statistical Analysis Center's website then we downloaded the xlsx format, and we definitely credit the data source.

## Expected Limitations

* Our findings can have major implications on the quality of livelihood and safety of citizens of Washington. For policymakers, implications would suggest investing more resources into policing counties that have higher rater of criminal activity. Or perhaps a certain area always has high crime at a certain hour, policymakers could look into requiring a lockdown past 1am where if you don't have lawful reason to be outside you'd receive a citation.

* We collectively expect the our project to concretely display which areas to avoid in Washington and what times to avoid them. An implication that arises for technologists is expanding off of our findings to include the entire Pacific Northwest or conversely, every city in Washington.

* Another implication surrounding the Designers that encounter our work would be operability. For example, a designer could find our work fascinating, but the ease-of-use isn't fairly easy. A UX Designer would be able to analyze the users needs and understand the most effective way to orient and organize information to make the product viable and inclusive to everyone.


## Limitations

* Although our dataset may have the times and locations of when each crime is commonly committed, we cannot guarantee the exact percentage of risk a certain time or location has.

* Our analysis of data does not yet have the exact accuracy of predicting when a crime will happen as our data is based on data that has been collected in the past. It requires a certain type of complicated algorithm(s) to be able to predict when a crime will happen.

* There is insufficient data from the years of 2021-2022. In order to fully analyze the crimes that happened in Washington State, it requires us to also analyze the reported crimes that happened recently. This allows space for errors and inaccuracy.

## Table

To construct state rankings, we used the 2019 FBI crime statistics for Washington State. The data collection initially had 7,430 cities. 2,929 cities were left after eliminating those with populations under 10,000. After dividing the total number of crimes by the population to obtain rates per 1,000, we next estimated the rates of violent and property crime. We also determined the number of law enforcement officers per 1,000 people. These were weighted by adding 50% to the rate of violent crime, -25% to the rate of property crime, and 25% to the rate of law enforcement. We received a safety index score from the resulting measure. The safer the city is, the higher this value.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY

### Example 1: Source some code and run a function

```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/chart1.R")
data_access_test()
```


### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it

```{r}
source("../source/chart1.R")

```


Our research shows that `r safest_city`

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
