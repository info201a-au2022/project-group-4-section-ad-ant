# Washington Crime (WAC): Project Proposal
Alyssa Limit, Nathan Narayana, Thomas Emnetu | INFO201AD | AU22

## Abstract :partly_sunny:

As we looked into the crime rate in the USA, we wondered why it's absurdly high. Then we ask ourselves, "If people can open their weather app for preventive measures, why isn't there a crime forecast app according to the time for preventive measures?". Thus, our crew creates WAC (Washington Crime), a platform that informs us if it's safe to leave the house at a specific hour, to address the problem.

## Introduction :dart:

During the first few weeks of the quarter, the UW community has been swamped with violence. There has been no sort of general system or data that tackles the issue of reducing victims caused by common crimes. This is important as our basic rights and needs as humans have the right to their safety. As informatics students, we try to accomplish this through our way of using knowledge learned in the class. Our goal is to reduce the number of victims from these criminal acts starting within the state of Washington. We plan to do this by collecting a set of data from the official government website of reported crimes around each county in Washington. These crimes include theft, shootings, vandalism, assault, and many more. We then proceed to analyze and present the data to the public of the general times and areas people should avoid to eliminate the risk of being a victim of those crimes. The summary of the data will be presented on a website.

## Problem Domain :bomb:

#### Project Framing
Early in the quarter, UW students were alerted by near UW. This news definitely triggered our anxiety. How is it possible for us to feel safe knowing that area near our school isn’t even safe? (Magaña & Zhou, 2022). Not only so, looking at the US reported violent crime graph from 1990 to 2021, this country is very familiar with violent crimes (FBI, 2022). Despite the decrease being visible, the numbers started to rise again from that point. Furthermore, it is great to keep in mind that the decrease of number doesn’t mean our country is safer. It is possible that criminals change their methods. New York Times show the shift in crimes. Although violent crimes such as murder is declining, there are few types of crimes that are inclining such as property crimes (Lopez, 2022). However, we will focus mainly on violent crimes in this project.

#### Human Values
Our team believes that every Washingtonians deserve to feel safe living here. Thus, we create WAC which can help Washingtonians make informed decisions on when to go out and understand if the area they’re in is safe or not at a certain time. We realized that crimes data are all scattered on the internet. We think it’d be great if we can compile all the crimes status and forecast based on the time pattern that people can see it in a platform.


#### Stakeholders (Direct and Indirect)
Direct Stakeholders will be the users. The users would most likely be Washington residents or visitors since we only provide this platform for Washington area based on the counties. It directly impacts their decision making by letting them know about the safety status to go out at a certain time. Thus, they can change their decisions according to the safety status. As for the indirect stakeholders, it can be the business owners in public places. Their customer waves may change depending on the safety status. They might receive more customers when the safety status is safe and receive less customers when it’s unsafe.

#### Possible Harms and Benefits
The Washingtonian may benefit from this platform because they will receive warnings when it is unsafe. It helps them make an informed decision to go out or not so they can make preventive measures. However, some criminals may take advantage of this app. They will be able to see the safety status and start committing crimes in the middle of safe time. Furthermore, we may not perfectly predict the crime because we’re going to work based on police notifications and local news. We do not have our own investigation team.

## Research Questions :question:

1.  How do UW students feel about the recent uprise in criminal activity around campus?

 * This question is important to understand the sentiment surrounding the basis of our project. What motivates this question is the fact that if students feel safe and have no concerns about the criminal activity, our project ceases to have any relevancy or impact.
2. This question is important because the suggestions that the UW community poses are a direct reflection of things that would increase their feeling of safety.
 * What motivates this question is rather than guess and check what would make the community feel safer, we can ask the community and expand off of their insights.
3. What are some ways that the UW community can keep each other informed on the severity of the criminal activity in the area?
 * This question is important because it allows us to analyze what the community at hand believes will be beneficial to keep them informed for their safety. What motivates this question is CBPR (community based participatory research) which is the research approach that equitably involves community members in the research process to effectively target the problem at hand.

## The Data Set :chart_with_upwards_trend:

(1) Our data set will aid us in answering our research questions in a few ways. First, after analyzing the data collected, we will begin to display our findings on a website that contains all relevant information. This answers the question on how the community could help each other on the severity of crime in an area. After looking at our findings, the community could better prepare themselves and others close to them by referring to the website. Secondly, our data set has data for crimes in all of the counties in Washington. From there, we could look up which crime is common in a certain area and how sever it is. This will help the community feel a lot more safe, as they have a sense of how dangerous or safe an area is.

(4) The data is collected by Washington Statistical Analysis Center. WSAC specialize in collecting data surrounding crime and justice. Their data is used for Washington policy and budget development. Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Justice Programs, and US Department of Justice funded WSAC through a grant. Since the data from WSAC is being used for creating and revising Washington Policy, those who gained benefit from it can be any institutions that may be related to crime prevention. Furthermore, this data is being used as the reference for budget development, some institutions may receive more or less budget because of this data. Hence, reliable data surveillance must be very strict. The commissioner need to make sure that the data is not being manipulated so people can take advantage from it. WSAC uses Summary Reporting System (SRS) and National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and they are part of FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting System. We obtained the data from WSAC website then we downloaded the xlsx format, and we definitely credit the data source.



## Limitations :jack_o_lantern:

* Although our dataset may have the times and locations of when each crime is commonly committed, we cannot guarantee the exact percentage of risk a certain time or location has.

* Our analysis of data does not yet have the exact accuracy of predicting when a crime will happen as our data is based on data that has been collected in the past. It requires a certain type of complicated algorithm(s) to be able to predict when a crime will happen.

* There is insufficient data from the years of 2021-2022. In order to fully analyze the crimes that happened in Washington State, it requires us to also analyze the reported crimes that happened recently. This allows space for errors and inaccuracy.
