# Washington Crime (WAC): Project Proposal
Alyssa Limit, Nathan Narayana, Thomas Emnetu | INFO201AD | AU22

## Introduction

During the first few weeks of the quarter, the UW community has been swamped with violence. There has been no sort of general system or data that tackles the issue of reducing victims caused by common crimes. This is important as our basic rights and needs as humans have the right to their safety. As informatics students, we try to accomplish this through our way of using knowledge learned in the class. Our goal is to reduce the number of victims from these criminal acts starting within the state of Washington. We plan to do this by collecting a set of data from the official government website of reported crimes around each county in Washington. These crimes include theft, shootings, vandalism, assault, and many more. We then proceed to analyze and present the data to the public of the general times and areas people should avoid to eliminate the risk of being a victim of those crimes. The summary of the data will be presented on a website.

## Research Questions

1.  How do UW students feel about the recent uprise in criminal activity around campus?

 * This question is important to understand the sentiment surrounding the basis of our project. What motivates this question is the fact that if students feel safe and have no concerns about the criminal activity, our project ceases to have any relevancy or impact.
2. This question is important because the suggestions that the UW community poses are a direct reflection of things that would increase their feeling of safety.
 * What motivates this question is rather than guess and check what would make the community feel safer, we can ask the community and expand off of their insights.
3. What are some ways that the UW community can keep each other informed on the severity of the criminal activity in the area?
 * This question is important because it allows us to analyze what the community at hand believes will be beneficial to keep them informed for their safety. What motivates this question is CBPR (community based participatory research) which is the research approach that equitably involves community members in the research process to effectively target the problem at hand.

## The Data Set

(1) Our data set will aid us in answering our research questions in a few ways. First, after analyzing the data collected, we will begin to display our findings on a website that contains all relevant information. This answers the question on how the community could help each other on the severity of crime in an area. After looking at our findings, the community could better prepare themselves and others close to them by referring to the website. Secondly, our data set has data for crimes in all of the counties in Washington. From there, we could look up which crime is common in a certain area and how sever it is. This will help the community feel a lot more safe, as they have a sense of how dangerous or safe an area is.


## Limitations

* Although our dataset may have the times and locations of when each crime is commonly committed, we cannot guarantee the exact percentage of risk a certain time or location has.

* Our analysis of data does not yet have the exact accuracy of predicting when a crime will happen as our data is based on data that has been collected in the past. It requires a certain type of complicated algorithm(s) to be able to predict when a crime will happen.
* There is insufficient data from the years of 2021-2022. In order to fully analyze the crimes that happened in Washington State, it requires us to also analyze the reported crimes that happened recently. This allows space for errors and inaccuracy.
